Surgery Clinic Booking Management System

This project aims to create an efficient management system for a surgery clinic. The system will handle tasks such as booking surgeries, scheduling operations, and managing post-operative care, ensuring a seamless experience for patients and staff.

To get started, each patient must register by providing their personal details (name, surname, tax code, date of birth, email, phone number) and basic health information such as blood type, allergies, and chronic conditions. Patients can also link an insurance policy, including details such as policy number, company, and expiration date.

The clinic employs several doctors, each with their own specialties. Each doctor has a profile (name, surname, registration number, and areas of expertise) and manages their own calendar to indicate their weekly availability.

Surgeries are categorized by type and complexity. Each type requires specific resources, such as an operating room and specialized equipment, and has a standard estimated duration. Operating rooms are equipped with different features to accommodate different types of operations.

Before the operation, the system ensures that the patient's pre-operative tests are recorded and verified for validity, as outdated tests must be redone. After the operation, the system tracks the patient's post-operative care, including medications administered and scheduled check-ups. Additionally, the platform manages the patient's medical records, documenting all admissions and treatments.

Nursing staff are assigned to patients during their hospital stay, with organized work shifts to ensure consistent care.
