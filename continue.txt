Project Overview:
This is a hospital management system designed to handle:
- Patient registration and medical records
- Doctor scheduling and availability
- Surgery scheduling and tracking
- Post-operative care management
- Nursing staff coordination

The system is being developed using:
- Node.js with Express for the backend
- Prisma ORM for database management
- MySQL as the database
- TypeScript for type safety
- REST API architecture

Current Project State:
- Database connection established with MySQL
- Prisma schema generated from existing database
- Basic API endpoints implemented:
  * Patient management
  * Doctor management
  * Doctor availability
  * Surgery scheduling
  * Post-operative care tracking
