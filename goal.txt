Create an ER diagram for this test: This project aims to create an intervention management system for a surgical clinic. The system will manage activities such as scheduling surgical procedures, organizing operations, and managing post-operative care, ensuring a smooth experience for patients and staff.
To begin, each patient must register by providing their personal data (first name, last name, fiscal code, date of birth, email, phone number) and basic health information such as blood type and allergies. They can then request a visit with a specific doctor, choosing from dates when the doctor is available.
The clinic employs several doctors, each with their own specializations. Each doctor has a profile (first name, last name, registration number, and areas of expertise) and manages their own calendar to indicate weekly availability.
Surgical operations are categorized by type and complexity. Each type requires specific resources, such as an operating room and specialized equipment, and has an estimated standard duration. After the operation, the system tracks the patient's post-operative care, including administered medications and information about activities to avoid.
